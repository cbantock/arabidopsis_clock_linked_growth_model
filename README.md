# Modeling the effects of circadian clock regulation of ELF3 and COP1 expression on hypocotyl elongation in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

Circadian rhythms are endogenous physiological processes that mirror diurnal environmental
periodicity and persist in the absence of environmental cues (McClung 2006). These rhythmic
processes are driven by the circadian clock, an endogenous timekeeper that is ubiquitous in
nature and responsible for generating and maintaining 24 hour rhythms. Circadian clocks allow
organisms to synchronize temporal phases of physiology with environmental cycles in order to
ensure optimal timing of biological events on both daily and seasonal time scales (Covington et
al., 2001). External light and temperature cues set the core molecular oscillator to local
conditions (Thines and Harmon 2010).

In plants, the circadian clock contributes to photoperiodic control over growth and development,
to plant response to abiotic stress, as well as to coordinating genome-wide changes in
transcription (McClung 2006). Recent work in Arabidopsis thaliana has demonstrated that plants
that have a circadian oscillator matched to the environmental period exhibit higher overall
biomass, elevated rates of photosynthesis, and improved chances of survival in a mixed
population. Thus, the presence of a robust circadian clock can increase competitive advantage
and elevate plant fitness (Dodd et al., 2005). Elucidating the architectural structure of this clock
mechanism and other clock regulated pathways has important implications for our overall
understanding of plant growth and development.

Recent advances in computational and experimental studies of the circadian clock in
Arabidopsis thaliana have led to new models of the clock gene network that include a
three-component repressilator circuit (Pokhilko et al., 2012). The new circadian clock model of
Pokhilko et al. (2013) suggests that the plant clock functions as an integrated, multi-feedback
system that maintains robust oscillations and entrainment under multiple perturbations.
Beyond understanding circadian rhythms themselves, a key motivation for studying the
circadian clock and developing a comprehensive model is to be able to study and better
understand the mechanisms underlying many processes that are controlled by the clock. One
such process is plant growth and hypocotyl elongation, which is gated by light and the circadian
clock through a coincidence mechanism (De Caluwé et al., 2016).

The main objective of this master’s thesis was to thus integrate the clock model developed by
Pokhilko et al. (2013) with one developed by Cristina Nieto et al. (2022) for modeling light and
temperature cues in hypocotyl elongation. This is possible as hypocotyl elongation is subject to
photoperiodic regulation by the circadian clock through PIF4 and PIF5 (phytochrome interacting
factors) transcription (Seaton et al., 2015). The integration of these two models will allow us to
take a holistic approach to understanding the circadian clock through its interaction in output
pathways. Future advancements and analysis of this coupled model would highlight the
underlying molecular mechanisms that coordinate plant growth across changing conditions and
may provide insights into the overall contribution of the clock to plant fitness.
